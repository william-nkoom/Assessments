\title{Function to generate dummy variables for categorical variables
This function generates dummy variables where levels of the categories are
encoded 0 or 1.
For example, for a dichotomic variable like gender, males may be encoded 0
and females encoded 1.
For a categorical variable of more than 2 levels, all levels are encoded 0,
where the label for that level is false, and encoded 1 if the the label
is true for an observation.
For example educational level with say high school, bachelor and masters
as the levels, a person with masters may be encoded 1 but 0 high school
and bachelor in the dataset. Where an observation is is encoded 0 for
both high school and bachelor, it is implied that the person has masters,
in which case this scenario can consider masters as the reference point.}
\usage{
generate_dummies(data, variables, reference_level = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame containing the variables to be encoded}

\item{variables}{character vector
specifying levels of the categorical variables}

\item{categories}{codes 1 or 0, to reflect the codes of the levels
of categories}

\item{labels}{optional list of labels for the categories of each variable}

\item{reference}{reference level indicating  where all other levels of the
categorical data are encoded 0}

\item{keep}{optional logical vector indicating whether to retain
the original character variables in the output data frame
Default is `True`for all variables}
}
\value{
data frame with new categorical variables added
specify the codes assigned to  each level of the categorical variable.
 Each new column is named as `variable category`, where `variable`
 is the name of the original categorical variable
